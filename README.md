The Intergalactic IEM Sonic Spectrometer
üöÄ About This App
Welcome to The Intergalactic IEM Sonic Spectrometer! This is a cutting-edge web application designed for audiophiles and music lovers to visualize and understand the sound signatures of In-Ear Monitors (IEMs). The app provides a futuristic, interactive experience, allowing users to explore how different hardware settings (filters and modes) affect the frequency response for various music genres.

The interface is designed with a sleek, neon "spaceship" aesthetic, providing a tactile and immersive feel to the digital space of audio customization.

‚ú® Features
Genre-Based Recommendations: Select from a wide variety of music genres to get an instant, expert-recommended configuration. The app automatically sets the optimal IEM mode and filter for your chosen genre.

Interactive Controls:

IEM Mode Select: Toggle between "MONITOR" mode for a flat, analytical sound and "POP" mode for a more dynamic, V-shaped signature.

Filter Selection: Choose from five distinct hardware filters (Black, Silver, Blue, Gold, Red), each providing a unique adjustment to the mid-high frequencies.

Real-Time Frequency Response Graph: A vibrant, neon graph instantly visualizes the changes to the IEM's sound signature as you adjust settings. The graph is powered by Chart.js and provides a clear representation of the audio output.

Dynamic Descriptions: The app provides concise, evocative descriptions explaining why a specific configuration is ideal for a selected genre. In "Free-Play" mode, it even suggests genres that would complement your custom setup.

Stunning Visuals: A dark, synthwave-inspired theme with neon purple and teal highlights creates an immersive, high-tech experience.

Fully Responsive: The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

üéß How to Use
The app has two primary modes of operation:

Genre Recommendation Mode (Default):

Simply click on any of the genres listed at the top of the application.

The controls for "IEM Mode Select" and "Filter" will automatically adjust to the recommended settings for that genre.

The frequency graph will update, and a detailed description will appear, explaining the sonic profile.

Free-Play Mode:

To enter Free-Play mode, manually change any setting. Click the "MONITOR/POP" switch or select a different filter color.

The description panel will now show you which genres your custom configuration is well-suited for.

Experiment with different combinations to discover new and unique sound signatures!
